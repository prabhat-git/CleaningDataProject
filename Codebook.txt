Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Adapted)
Version 1.0
==================================================================
This data set was created as part of student project for
'Gathering and Cleaning Data' offered by Coursera.
==================================================================

The dataset provided here is an adapted version of "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset".
The original dataset and its description including README.txt can be found at the following location:

In the original dataset, data from 30 individuals is randomly partitioned into two sets 'train' and 'test'.
and placed in directories with the same names. . Each directory contains the following three files :
1. subject_test.txt/subject_train.txt - Individual subject involved in a particular observation (single column dataset).
2. y_test.txt/y_train.txt - Activity involved in a particular observation (single column dataset).
3. X_test.txt/X_train.txt - Preprocessed sensor signals data (from accelerometer and gyroscope) for a particular observation.
   (561 column dataset).
   
The current dataset tries to consolidate and summarize important information scattered over several files to
a single file, activity_measure_mean.txt. Following transformations are performed to the original dataset
to achieve this.

1.  The 'test' and 'train' datasets are merged into a single datasets. The rows from the datasets of each of
    the three sets of files, as mentioned above, are combined.
2. The single column in file y.txt (created from merger of y_test.txt and y_train.txt) is named 'activity' and the
   column data is changed from activity code to actual activity name (e.g., STANDING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS etc.).
   The modified data is saved in file activity.txt.
3. X.txt (resultant file from merger of X_test.txt and X_train.txt) is subsetted to select only those columns
   that contains mean() or std() information. The file feature.txt in the original dataset contains features (names)
   of the data from the sensors. Information from this dataset is used to select the columns in X.txt.
4. Information from feature.txt file is also used to give descriptive names to the columns of X.txt.
   Modified X.txt file is saved in file activity_measurements.txt.
5. Subject column from subject.txt, activity column from activity.txt are added as first and the second column to
   data in activity_measurements.txt. 
6. gather() function from tidyr package is used to gather feature names in key value pair.
7. aggregate() function is used to get the average of each feature for each activity for each subject. The result
   of this transformation is saved in activity_measure_mean.txt.
   
The dataset in activity_measure_mean.txt has 11880 rows and 4 columns. 
The 4 columns correspond to subject, activity, feature and mean value (of the measurement).
11880 rows corresponds to 30 subject each performing 6 activities and having 66 measurement points.
